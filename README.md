## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Fill in the form and see the card details update in real-time
- Receive error messages when the form is submitted if:
  - Any input field is empty
  - The card number, expiry date, or CVC fields are in the wrong format
- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover, active, and focus states for interactive elements on the page

## My process

### What I learned

What caused me the most trouble were the CSS and JS aspects of the challenge. I understand that they are not particularly complex, and once you know what to do, it becomes quite simple. However, I constantly found myself trying to make it more efficient, which ended up taking much more time than I initially anticipated.

I acknowledge that this may not be the best or most efficient solution, but I'm satisfied with it for a first attempt. To implement a desktop view, I ended up using media queries, although I recognize that it may not be the best approach. Unfortunately, I couldn't come up with a better solution and I want to work on other projects.

For the most part, the JavaScript part was mostly a repetition of what I did in the age component challenge.

### Continued development

I still have a lot to learn and improve upon in JavaScript. Each time I work on these small projects, I make incremental progress. I plan to revisit this project and explore different approaches made by other users and expand my understanding of these languages.
