## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Fill in the form and see the card details update in real-time
- Receive error messages when the form is submitted if:
  - Any input field is empty
  - The card number, expiry date, or CVC fields are in the wrong format
- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover, active, and focus states for interactive elements on the page

## My process

### What I learned

The two parts which gave me the most trouble were the CSS and JS parts of the challenge. I know that they are not really complex and once you know what to do it's quite simple, but I was constantly thinking of how to make it more efficient and that made me spend a lot more time than what I originally thought was needed.

I know that this is not the best or most efficient solution but I'm happy for a first try.

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```

### Continued development

I have to grow my JavaScript skills a lot further, thanks to all the little projects I do I progress a little bit everytime. I do want to try redoing this project with different CSS approaches and expand my understanding of it.
